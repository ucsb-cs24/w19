Complete your reading of Chapter 9 (If you don't have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<ol markdown="1">

1. (10 pts) Write a recursive function to check if an input string is a palindrome. Decide on the parameters and return type of the function as appropriate.
<div style="margin-bottom:40em"></div>

2. (10 pts) Consider the following definition of a doubly linked-list.
<div markdown="1">
```
class LinkedList{
	public:
		LinkedList():head(0), tail(0){}
		~LinkedList();
		void reverse(); //reverses the order of elements in the linked list
		void insert(int value);
	private:
	    struct Node{
  			int data;
  			Node* next;
  			Node* prev;
		};
		Node* head;
		Node* tail;
		//Add your helper function here that recursively reverses the order of elements in the linked list


};
```
</div>

Write the declaration of a helper function in the class provided above that recursively reverses the order of elements in the linked list. This function will be used by the reverse() method. The implementation of the function should be provided on the next page.
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>


<div class="pagebreak"></div>


3. (20 pts) Consider the doubly linked list in the previous question. Implement the reverse method that uses a helper function to recursively reverse the order of elements in a linked list. You must implement the helper function as well.

<div style="margin-bottom:50em"></div>


4. (10 pts) Write a recursive function that finds the sum of the first 'n' odd positive integers. 
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>



</ol>
