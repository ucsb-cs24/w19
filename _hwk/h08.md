1. (10 pts) Write a template function named IsEqual() that compares two items and returns a boolean. If the items are equal the function should return true otherwise it should return false. The function has two parameters of the same type. The type may be any type that has a copy constructor and the == operator defined.

2. (10 pts) Re-read pages 314-315. Then consider the Sequence class provided at the link<a href= "https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-w18/hw5/blob/master/sequence.h">https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-w18/hw5/blob/master/sequence.h</a>. The Sequence class currently stores a list of words in a static array. Convert this class to a template class that can be used to store a collection of any datatype instead of just std::string. Write the new definition of the Sequence class below. You don't have to implement the methods.
