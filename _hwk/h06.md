Complete your reading of Chapter 1, Section 1.2. If you don't have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<ol markdown="1">
1. (10 pts) What is the Big-O time complexity of the following code:

<div markdown="1">

```
for(int i=0; i<N; i+=2) {
	...constant time operations...
}
```
</div>
Justify your answer.

2. (10 pts) What is the Big-O time complexity of the following code:

<div markdown="1">
```
for(int i=1; i<N; i*=2) {
	...constant time operations...
}
```
</div>
Justify your answer.

3. (20 pts) What is the Big-O time complexity of the following code: 

<div markdown="1">

```
int x = 10;
for(int i=1; i<N; i*=2) {
	for(int j=0; j<N; j+=2) {
		x++;
	}
}
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

4. (10 pts) Provide a link to your github repo for pa02. Analyze the Big-O complexity of the insert, delete and search methods of your implementation of the CardList (linked list class). Assume that Alice and Bob each have exactly N cards. Provide your analysis here. As a challenge problem, analyze the Big-O complexity of your entire game.
